      <h1>Which league is right for you?</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            The Nationally sanctioned leagues out there are APA, Billiards
            Congress of America (BCA) Valley National 8-Ball Association (VNEA)
            and a few other smaller leagues not worth mentioning. Then there are
            zillions of local bar leagues that are not sanctioned and usually
            are ran by an individual and have no affiliation with any national
            organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The APA is clearly the largest league with over 250,000 members
            nation wide it has more members than all of the other national
            leagues combined. With their handicapping system and huge national
            tournaments it offers more to it’s players than the other leagues.
            It does however have some drawbacks… In order to play in the
            championship events your team must qualify by winning your local
            division play-offs then in some cases an end of session tournament
            with all of the local winners followed by a local championship that
            has all of the winners of each league season (3 seasons per year)
            playing off for the opportunity to play in the National Championship
            in Las Vegas. This is no easy task and many teams play in this
            league for years and never qualify. But, I can tell you from
            experience the APA Nationals are a sight to behold! 200 pool tables
            and 10,000 players all playing the exact same rules that you play at
            in your local bar on league night. It was something I will never
            forget even though we only won 2 matches and were promptly knocked
            out of the tournament!
          </p>
          <p>
            The BCA and VNEA leagues are geared more towards the better players.
            They allow you to stack your team with all of the great players you
            can find and because of this you see the same teams winning year
            after year. With no handicap system it teaches you to swim with the
            sharks or get eaten by them. If your desire is to become a great
            player and pool is more than a recreational hobby for you then these
            are great leagues to join. You don’t have to qualify for the
            Nationals all you usually need to do is play 1 season with your team
            and you can go. Also they allow you to adjust your team roster and
            go to the championship with ANY players that have completed a league
            season. These events you just sign your team up, pay your expenses
            and you are in the big time!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several other types of leagues. Bar leagues that… you
            guessed it…. play in bars. Most bar leagues are travel leagues which
            means they travel from one bar to another depending on the schedule
            and which locations host teams. Then there are In-House leagues
            that…no, don’t play in your house…it means they play at one location
            only for the whole season. You also have money leagues that just
            play for the cash payout at the end of the season. Another fun type
            of league is the “Trip” league where everyone that participates gets
            to go on a fun trip to Las Vegas, Laughlin or some other fun place
            to hang out with your teammates at the end of the season.
