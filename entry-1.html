            There are so many different gadgets for shaping, scuffing,
            scrimming, smoothing, polishing, cleaning, chalking, burnishing…
            whew! How can you possibly know what to carry? What is needed? Not
            needed? I know players that carry so many gadgets their case looks
            like a mechanics tool chest! Here is a brief guide to what you
            should carry with you, what you don’t really need and what you can’t
            leave home without!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Shapers</strong> : MUST HAVE. As mentioned in a previous
            blog post, the tip is the most important part of your cue and having
            it properly shaped is just as important. There are many different
            types of shaping tools but some of the best are: Ultimate Shaper,
            Porper’s Shaper/Tacker, Willards, TruTip, Cue Cube and my favorite
            is the all in 1 B.A.T. Shaper from www.cue-tools.com The B.A.T.
            Shaper is a Bridge, Aerator, Tapper and Shaper built into an all
            aircraft aluminum tool. There is nothing like it on the market.
            Check out their website for more details and photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Slip On Bridge</strong>: MUST HAVE: There are only a couple
            types on the market but I suggest you carry one. Almost every time
            you play you will inevitably approach the table only to find you
            can’t reach the shot. Having a bridge head that easily slips on to
            any cue will solve this dilemma. There is an inexpensive gadget
            commonly referred to as the moosehead bridge or as mentioned before
            the B.A.T. Shaper either will take care of this situation when it
            comes up in your next game.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Shaft Conditioner</strong>: SHOULD HAVE. You should carry
            some type of cloth, or mild abrasive papers to smooth your cue
            shaft. Q-Wiz, Q-Smooth, Tiger Shaft Smoother and my recommendation
            SHAFT-M8 by Cue-tools.com. The best part about SHAFT-M8 is it’s an
            actual cloth with micro abrasives woven into the material mounted on
            a soft foam core. It is the equivalent to 3200 grit sandpaper and
            will not harm your cue. It is washable and re-usable and will last
            for years. These type of shaft conditioners will keep your shaft
            silky smooth and feeling great while you play.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pocket Chalker</strong>: MIGHT WANT. Having some type of
            personal chalker isn’t really needed but they are nice to have. Most
            places provide chalk but if you don’t like the brand of chalk at
            your local bar or pool hall it is very easy to bring some of your
            favorite chalk with you. If you are one of those gadget loving
            people like myself you can look for the TiP STiK or ULTiM-8 Chalker
            on CUE-TOOLS.COM. They both have needles built into them to aerate
            your tip to hold chalk better and on the ULTiM-8 the part that goes
            into your pocket has machined shapers to scuff and properly shape
            your tip to hold chalk better.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cue Holders</strong>: MIGHT WANT. There are several types of
            cue holders you can use to keep your cues from falling over between
            turns at the table. Q-Claw, Qlaw, Cue Caddy and my favorite Cue It
            Up which is a light weight clip that clamps on to most pub tables or
            drink rails in the bar and allows you to rest your cues in notches
            on the clip to help protect it from getting knocked over while you
            aren’t using them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hand Powder</strong>: NOT NEEDED. Unless your hands are very
            sweaty stay away from powder. It isn’t good for your cues and it
            will make a mess of everything in your case.
          </p>
