      <h1>Is league playing right for you?</h1>

          <p>
            Do you love competition but don‚Äôt want to go out and hustle pool for
            a living? Or do you feel that you‚Äôre just not good enough to play in
            tournaments yet? Then I have a great solution‚Ä¶.Leagues!
          </p>
          <p>
            That's right! Just like with bowling there are amateur pool leagues
            everywhere. The first thing I always hear when I mention pool
            leagues is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough... üòï‚Äù But the truth is:
            <strong>YOU ARE</strong> good enough! The American Pooplplayers
            Association Pool League (APA) is the largest pool league in the
            world. It didn‚Äôt get that way by recruiting only good players. They
            are so successful because to them, it's all about the game not the
            talent. As they say, ‚ÄúEveryone Can Play‚Ä¶ Anyone Can Win!‚Äù The
            majority of their league (75%) is made of average to below average
            skilled players. It is one of the only leagues that requires a
            balance of all skill levels on each team and with their Equalizer
            Handicap System it really is true that anyone can win!
          </p>
          <p>
            Each player has a handicap rating from skill level 2 (Absolute
            beginner) to 7 (Very highly skilled) and everything in between. So
            for example if you are a skill level 3 and you have to play a skill
            level 6 you would be required to win 2 games before your opponent
            won 5 games. This levels the playing field dramatically! The APA is
            also the only league that offers over $1,000,000 in prize money at
            it‚Äôs National Championship events that are held several times per
            year in Las Vegas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best part about how their league is structured, though, is the
            ‚Äú23 rule." This is when teams <em>(5 players)</em> cannot have a
            collective handicap <em>(skill ratings)</em> of more than 23. This
            makes it impossible to stack a team with all 6‚Äôs and 7‚Äôs and
            requires each team to have some lower skilled players (2‚Äôs, 3‚Äôs
            etc.) in order to play. So, go out and play! The APA League Teams
            need you if you "aren't good enough".
